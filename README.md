# Mushroom Hat
### This is a fun and simply project I did with friends, where we made cardboard mushroom hats with sound reactive LEDs.

### Cardboard structure
First I CADed a simple hat structure in Fusion 360 ([mushroom.stl](mushroom.stl)). I then put it through Slicer for Fusion 360 with a radial slice to get the cut layout ([mushroom_slice.pdf](mushroom_slice.pdf)), which we could then laser cut from cardboard. 

This let us have a sturdy, lightweight cardboard hat.

### LEDs
We cut notches in the hat so that we could place the LEDs in three layers. A friend saudered them together, and then to an ESP8266, which allowed us to program the lights using [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) and [LEDFX](https://www.ledfx.app/). The ESP8266 was connected to a portable battery so that we could wear the hats and move around. The ESP8266 has WiFi, so we were able to control the LEDs from our phones. 

### Finishing Touches
I cut large red fabric covers with holes to go over the top of the mushroom, and hot glued tulle to the bottoms for aesthetics. I then added a large yarn rope so they would stay on our heads, and the mushrooms were done! :)
